# AL-EVENTO
SOCIAL NETWORKING SITE FOR COLLEGE SOCIETIES
Working:
The site was designed keeping in my mind three types of users
1.	Club President
2.	Club Members
3.	Audience
Objective:
There are over 30 clubs/societies in our college each one with a different motto. Example: ‘LitSoc’. This club organizes literary events like debates, JAM’s etc. This repeats for all the 30 clubs. Each club trying to attract maximum audience. Through AL:EVENTO we targeted at giving these all clubs a common platform for promotion of their events and performance tracking capabilities through user ratings on their events.  
•	People from audience can follow clubs to keep a track of upcoming events. 
•	The members and admin can create events and further make posts having the tags of their club and the respective event.
•	Users visiting the site could follow a club or send a request to join the club. People from audience can view the posts from his/her followed club and rate it.
•	Clubs were given positions according to their event/post ratings. The position of the club decided its tag color (from a set of 10 colors). Ex: Black tag indicated the most famous club compared to others.
